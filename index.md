## About Me

I completed my bachelor’s degree in a field closely related to the practical application of machine learning.

This experience helped me realise that analytics and working with models are not my strong suit, whereas academic projects involving direct development and design gave me clarity about my future career path.

Developing MVP services using Python was what I gained from academic projects, but I always wanted to dive into developing services of a different format — more systemic. However, I only found the time for this after defending my thesis.

That’s how I immersed myself in learning the languages used to write the vast majority of system software — C and C++, as well as tools necessary for productive development of system products.

At this stage, it is important for me to find a place where, on the one hand, I can put my skills to the test, and on the other — develop them further.

## Projects

### Real‑Time Video Stream Analysis Service ([Farseer](https://github.com/mmmhdp/farseer))

*Coursework*

* Implemented an asynchronous service for real‑time analysis of RTSP video streams with a microservices architecture.
* Developed an asynchronous REST API to manage requests to the service.
* Integrated a processing component with object detection inference based on a YOLO model.

**Technologies:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Docker, Git

### Virtual Avatar Interaction Service ([Bishop](https://github.com/mmmhdp/bishop))

*Team graduation project (experimental format)*

* Developed the project’s UI as a SPA (Single‑Page Application).
* Implemented the backend for a range of tasks — from user authentication and metadata storage to text and audio generation.
* Integrated an audio pipeline for generating voiceovers for avatar messages.

**Technologies:** Python, FastAPI, FastHTML, Docker, YOLO, Git

### EEPROM SPI Memory Driver (25LC040A) ([task1](https://github.com/mmmhdp/infotecs_junior_position_assigment))

*Project completed as part of the selection process for a Junior Developer position at Company N*

* Designed and implemented a C++ abstraction for working with SPI EEPROM (25LC040A) using a bit‑banging driver.
* Developed a memory access API supporting reading and writing a single bit, a single byte, and a byte array.
* Documented all public interfaces, constants, and enumerations using Doxygen.

**Technologies:** C++, Doxygen, Git, CMake

### Custom Fixed‑Size Memory Allocator (C) ([task2](https://github.com/mmmhdp/infotecs_junior_position_assigment))

*Project completed as part of the selection process for a Junior Developer position at Company N*

* Implemented a custom memory allocator in pure C with support for two fixed allocation sizes (15 and 180 bytes).
* Wrote unit tests using Google Test to verify allocation, block reuse, and error handling.

**Technologies:** C, Google Test, Git, CMake

### LRU Cache Implementation in C ([caching](https://github.com/mmmhdp/bscalg/tree/main/calg/caching))

*Coursework*

Implemented an **LRU (Least Recently Used) cache** in pure C with constant‑time operations.

* Built key data structures: a hash table, a doubly linked list, and a cache based on them.
* Developed comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness of the hash table, linked list, and cache itself.

**Technologies:** C, Git, Google Tests, Make
