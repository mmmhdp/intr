## Projects

### Real-Time Video Stream Analysis Service (Farseer)
*Pet / Academic Project*  
https://github.com/mmmhdp/farseer

- Designed and implemented an asynchronous service for real-time video stream analysis
- Built request lifecycle management using an explicit finite state machine (FSM) with real-time status updates
- Implemented a proxy-write pattern to ensure data consistency between Redis and PostgreSQL using background workers
- Integrated RTSP video streams with concurrent frame processing using multithreading
- Developed an async REST API using FastAPI for request management
- Integrated object detection inference as a processing component
- Used PostgreSQL for persistent state storage and MinIO for media storage

**Tech stack:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, RTSP, multithreading

### Voice-Based Conversational AI Platform (Bishop)
*Team Diploma Project*  
https://github.com/mmmhdp/bishop

- Developed a full-stack conversational application with voice-based interaction
- Implemented backend services for user registration, authentication, and chat management
- Built frontend interfaces using FastHTML, including user dashboard, chat UI, and model interaction interface
- Integrated audio processing pipeline for voice input and output
- Worked with speech and language models, including experimentation with model fine-tuning
- Designed end-to-end system workflow across frontend, backend, and ML inference layers
- Focused on application architecture and system integration rather than ML research

**Tech stack:** Python, FastHTML, backend services, audio processing, ML model integration
